# Design for `accounts.py` Module

The `accounts.py` module contains a self-contained implementation of an account management system for a trading simulation platform. Below is a detailed design of the classes and functions to be implemented in this module.

## Class: Account

The core class representing a user's account. This class encapsulates account balance, transactions, and share holdings.

### Attributes:

- `balance`: `float` - Represents the current available balance in the account.
- `transactions`: `list` - A list to store all transactions with details.
- `holdings`: `dict` - A dictionary mapping stock symbols to quantities of shares owned.
- `initial_deposit`: `float` - Records the initial deposit for profit/loss calculations.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self) -> None`
Initializes a new account with a zero balance, no holdings, and no transactions.

#### `create_account(self, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
- Parameters:
  - `initial_deposit`: The amount of money to initially deposit into the account.
- Behavior: Sets the initial deposit and adjusts the account balance accordingly.

#### `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: Amount to deposit into the account.
- Behavior: Increases the account balance by the deposited amount.

#### `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: Amount to withdraw from the account.
- Returns:
  - `bool`: Indicates success or failure of the withdrawal.
- Behavior: Decreases the account balance by the specified amount if sufficient funds exist.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: Stock symbol of the shares to buy.
  - `quantity`: Number of shares to buy.
- Returns:
  - `bool`: Indicates success or failure of the purchase.
- Behavior: Purchases shares if the account balance suffices, otherwise returns false.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: Stock symbol of the shares to sell.
  - `quantity`: Number of shares to sell.
- Returns:
  - `bool`: Indicates success or failure of the sale.
- Behavior: Sells the shares if enough shares are held, otherwise returns false.

#### `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Returns:
  - `float`: Total current value of the portfolio including shares and available balance.

#### `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
- Returns:
  - `float`: The profit or loss relative to initial deposit considering current portfolio value and cash balance.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
- Returns:
  - `dict`: The current holdings of the account (stock symbols with quantities).

#### `list_transactions(self) -> list`
- Returns:
  - `list`: A list of all executed transactions.

## Function: `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
A test implementation for retrieving the current price of a share that returns fixed prices for certain symbols.
- Returns fixed prices for:
  - `AAPL`: $150.00
  - `TSLA`: $700.00
  - `GOOGL`: $2800.00

### Usage:
This module is ready for integration and testing. It models fundamental functionalities for a trading simulation, ensuring transactions align with actual account constraints.
